# sqlalchemy-challenge
This challenge about SQLachemy revolves around data extraction, analysis, and visualization from a SQLite database using Python. First, I set up the Environment. Matplotlib for plotting the data. NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. SQLAlchemy to connect to and query the SQLite database. Datetime for handling and manipulating dates. The environment is set up to handle database reflection, session management, and data processing. Secondly, I set up the Database Connection. This establishes a connection to the SQLite database (hawaii.sqlite), which contains weather data like temperature, precipitation, and station details. Thirly, I set up the ORM, using SQLAlchemyâ€™s ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), in this step maps the database tables (measurement and station) to Python classes so to interact Python using ORM. Once the reflection is complete, a session is created, this allows querying the database by sending SQL-like commands from Python and retrieving the results. At the end of the process, the session is closed to prevent resource leakage. In summary, This challenge provided me the skills to performs data querying and exploratory analysis on a climate dataset stored in a SQLite database. It uses SQLAlchemy to query the database and Pandas to handle the data and calculate statistics. For visualization, Matplotlib is used to create line plots and histograms. The code is focused on analyzing climate station data such as precipitation levels, temperature observations, and station activity.
I work in this challenge with the assistance of a classmate Yara El-Eman and ChatGPT.
